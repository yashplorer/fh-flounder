Public Breastfeeding Sparks Controversy in China

A photo of a mother nursing her baby in a Beijing subway has recently caused a vast online debate in China over whether public breastfeeding is appropriate. The photo was taken by a subway passenger and posted on Weibo, China’s equivalent to Twitter on Nov. 27. The passenger also commented, “This is a Beijing subway, not a bus in your village.” The post went viral after being repost by Beijing Tale, a volunteer organization based in Beijing. It condemned the breastfeeding mother for exposing her “sexual organs” in public. 
The repost has unleashed furious online debates on public breastfeeding in China. Some Internet users agreed that it’s not appropriate to expose some part of breasts in public and that the mother should use some covers, while many supported the mother and criticized the passenger and Beijing Tale for sharing an intimate photo of the breastfeeding mother. 
The husband of the breastfeeding mother said the online debate caused trouble to his family. He said the mother had not choice but to breastfeed the baby in order to keep him from crying out loud in the subway. However, either having a crying baby in the subway or breastfeeding in public was embarrassing for the parents. 
Chinese laws don’t ban women from public breastfeeding, nor specifically allows women to breastfeed in any public space. It’s not surprising that this incident has revealed such a huge controversy on public breastfeeding in China. While 40% of mothers on average exclusively breastfeed their babies for at least six months in the world, only 16% of urban Chinese women and 30% of rural women do so in China according to a 2014 report by the World Health Organization. 
The low rates in China are caused by a combination of cultural and commercial factors. High percentage of working mothers and short maternity leave both make it difficult for mothers to continue to breastfeed once they return to work. And although there have been multiple formula factory scandals, Chinese mothers have shifted to purchase more expensive formula from overseas rather than to breastfeed the babies due to aggressive commercial tactics by global formula companies. 
China has tries to address the low breastfeeding rate problem by considering a ban on formula advertising in Beijing and launching a national Breastfeeding Awareness Day. However, the breastfeeding rate hasn’t increased much especially in urban cities.
