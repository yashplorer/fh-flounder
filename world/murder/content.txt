Two Israeli teens have been convicted on Monday for the murder of a Palestinian boy. The court in Jerusalem could not identify the convicted murders because they are minors.
The two were convicted of burning and killing 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir in July 2014. A third Israeli, an adult named Yosef Haim Ben-David, was also found responsible. But his judgment was temporarily suspended. The court held off on announcing a verdict for Ben-David because his legal team filed a psychiatric submission claiming he was not mentally responsible for his actions. Ben-David has failed to speak in court to defend himself throughout the proceeding. 
Mohammed was abducted, beaten on the head and burned alive after the killings of three Israeli teens a week earlier. His death sparked weeks of angry protests by Palestinians outraged by his death.
