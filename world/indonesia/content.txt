Indonesia in Danger Due to Palm Oil

Indonesia has the highest production of palm oil in the world. The rainforests in Indonesia are being cleared to make way for palm oil plantations, which are destroying the habitats that many species that live in and that many people depend on for living. Palm oil is a common ingredient used in many of the items you would find in grocery stores or even in your own home.  It can be found in items as diverse as lipsticks, chocolates, and toothpaste; and often used in the fuel that goes in cars.  There is a high demand for palm oil because of its ability to be produced more efficiently and with a cheaper cost. 	
	Although there are different methods used to clear rainforests, the quickest and most frequently used way is the slash-and-burn method. This method can cause problems because fires are intentionally set on lands to clear paths for plantation and as a result have created haze over Indonesia. The rainforest fires are causing a number of issues, such as decreased air quality, harm on individuals’ health, and loss of inhabits for animals like orangutans. Orangutans are either being killed by the habitat destruction or being caught for pet trade. Most of the orangutan species in the world are found in Indonesia, however due to the deforestation, the population has declined in recent years. Because of the thick haze covering Indonesia, people have to wear masks to cover themselves from inhaling any smoke or pollutants, and numerous Indonesians have already developed respiratory problems. This has become a huge problem in the country because the heavy pollution is making it difficult for people to go outside and continue on with their lives, and the country has called in for a state of emergency. The increased demand for palm oil has negatively impacted the rainforest and its inhabitants.
