Female genital mutilation has been practiced for many centuries in groups in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. This cultural practice consists of partially or completely cutting off the female genitalia in order to prevent a womanâ€™s sexual desire. The practice is also found in small areas within Europe and North America. Although FGM has been banned in many countries such as Kenya, Unite for Children, aka UNICEF still recognize FGM as a human rights violation and one of many [acts] of gender inequality. UNICEF also reveals that 3.6 million girls and women were affected by female genital mutilation (FGM) in 2013.
 FGM can cause short and long term issues such as infections (including HIV, because the same blade is normally used on all women being cut), psychological trauma, excruciating pain, scarring, and even result to death. Cutting can also cause girls to bleed excessively. Other risks include developing complications while giving birth and failure to conceive. 
In the past 25 years, data has been collected to better understand this practice in order to put an end to the FGM. And many resources are provided for women who are affected by FGM: reconstructive surgery, gynecological and psychological care for FGM victims. Among the world, there are various non-government organizations working on different projects to end FGM. Save The Children is aiming to empower women and girls with education and job opportunities as well as access to sexual and reproductive information and services. And Equality Now helps protect women and girls from FGM and provides legal services for the victims. Charitable organizations have stepped in and strived to provide medical treatment and education so that FGM will eventually be eliminated.
