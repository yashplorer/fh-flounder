As the water drops, history is revealed

The water level in the Nezahualcóyotl reservoir in Chiapas, Mexico, has dropped 82 feet due to the recent drought in the area. Because of the drop in water level, the ruins of an old church have risen from the depths.
The church, the Temple of Santiago or Temple of Quechula, was built in 1564. It was meant to support what was expected to be the growing population in the area.  But when the populations didn’t grow as expected, the church was only used intermittently until plague struck the surrounding area from 1773 to 1776. The area was devastated, and the church abandoned.
In 1966, the construction of a dam created the Nezahualcóyotl reservoir and submerged the ruins beneath 100 feet of water.
This is only the second time since the reservoir’s creation that drought has revealed the ruins. In 2002, the water level dropped to the point where people were able to walk thought the ruins. It prompted many tours, ceremonies, and celebrations amongst tourist and locals alike.  
This time, the water has not dropped to such a level as to allow walking tours, but local fishermen have been providing rides to the church and tourists are able to climb amongst the ruins.
