The addition of 211,000 new jobs into the U.S. economy surpassed Novembers expectations of the addition of only 192,000. 31,000 of those jobs were added in the retail sector, as shopping for the holidays begins to gear up as it does every November. Average hourly earnings rose 2.3%, a higher increase than earlier months in the year, while unemployment hovered around 5%, The lowest that it has been since the recession in 2008. “The U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession. The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in October of this year. At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level. The economy has created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession.” (Yellen) Wage growth in general for year to year remains stagnant however, rarely growing more than  2% a year. This strong performance of the economy precedes a meeting of the Federal Reserve, where lawmakers will determine whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost ten years. The volatility of the U.S. economy amid extensive uncertainty to matters in the middle east, such as the Iran nuclear deal and tremendous spending by the U.S. military in conducting war with ISIS, as well as the unofficial status of the Pacific Trade Agreement, has prevented the fed from raising interest rates in the past.
