The Winter

This winter, Americans can expect a variety of weather conditions differing from those of winters past, including heavy rains, drought, heavy storm activity, or lack thereof.  Abnormal warm or cold temperatures may also be expected in some regions.  All of these odd weather behaviors are due to El Niño.
El Niño refers to a pattern in which the central and eastern regions of the Pacific Ocean heat up.  It occurs once every two to seven years.  The extra heat in the ocean causes changes in the weather in the United States, as well as Australia, parts of Europe and Africa.  El Niño 2015 is expected to last until the spring of 2016, but in some instances the effects of El Niño can last up to two years (The Weather Channel). 
Predictions for 2015-2016 expect one of the strongest recorded El Niño episodes, and, therefore, some of the most notable changes in weather.  An El Niño event is considered strong when the temperature of the affected parts of the Pacific Ocean rises by 2 degrees Celsius.  El Niño 2015-2016 has raised the temperature of the sea by an average of 2.5 degrees Celsius.
Some of the shifts in weather will bring harm to people living in regions affected by El Niño, but there may also be some positive results from the differences in weather.  Californians should expect heavy rainfall this winter due to El Niño, which will bring both positive and negative effects to California.  The rainfall will likely lessen the severity of the current drought; however, it will possibly cause flooding and landslides as well.  In the southern United States, conditions are expected to be cooler and rainier than usual.  The east coast, on the other hand, foresees a drier and less stormy winter than usual.  The Midwest can also expect a milder winter with fewer tornadoes than normal (Weather Underground).
