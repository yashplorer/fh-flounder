The Good Dinosaur Bias Deconstruction
Alfredo Arredondo
Dec. 2, 2015
The story isn’t as revolutionary as I’ve come to expect from the world-class animation studio that brought us “Finding Nemo,” “Toy Story” and “Up.”
This writer uses Pixar’s name alone to try and set a standard that the movie has to a life altering experience. He references some of the company’s earlier films such as Up, Finding Nemo and Toy Story and is not letting The Good Dinosaur be its own thing. Morris also does not mentioned that the audience is Intended for kids. That piece of information is important to understand. He putting his thoughts on the page for adults who want to watch the movie without kids. If a kid wants to watch then a parent will likely go to see it because the kid wants to, not because a movie critic said so. 
He claims to have been watching movies for decades, and because a decade is a long amount of time, Morris believes he knows what he is talking about is trying convince the readers that he is someone worth gather insight from. He is speaking to the audience who is reading a kid movie review and tries to sympathize with them that he too has been a moviegoer and uses his past to guide him today.
Morris also liked that the director “called the dinosaur “sincere,” that’s a good way to describe the movie he and his Pixar collaborators have made”. 
Morris uses Pixar as a pronoun even for collaborators, which gives the reader the idea that because they are from pixar and they feel what they made is good that it must be good simply because they work at the studio that many believe to be the best in the world. The director’s quote put in here is to show that the director cares and that because sincerity is smiled upon then it is okay that that the movie is not what the adult reader expected the film to be.
