A home shopping channel is advertising the promotion of guns. From 1 A.M. to 7 A.M. eastern time, viewers will be able to buy the different types of guns that they will have for sale. The channel will also have ammunition, holsters, clothes for hunting, and many more gun accessories for the viewers to buy. Having their 6 hour showtime for seven nights a week, their products will be available for purchase twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The co-founders of the home shopping channel, believe that this will boost people’s interest in shooting sports and not worsen the problem of the demand on guns. For people’s safety, they will not ship the items to their homes but the buyers would have to pick up their purchases at a nearby licensed gun shop. They will then go through a background check and fill out paperwork for their items. The home shopping channel are hoping to extend their air time of 6 hours to 12 hours and eventually 24 hours.
