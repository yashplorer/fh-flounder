In the Movie “Creed” directed by Ryan Coogler scored high reviews from many well known critics. Many Praised the performance of the actors that included Michael B. Jordan played Adonis Johnson, Sylvester Stallone as himself “Rocky”, and Tessa Thompson played as Bianca. One of the seven actual boxer explained how he was able to talk to Jordan as a boxer because of the training he put in to obtain his role. Due to Jordan’s commitment he was able to create a flow that help make him seem like a more believable fighter to all the fans. Not only impressed by Jordan performance but Rocky’s role as well. Rocky was able to give the spotlight away yet have an impact on the main in the storyline. The critics not only enjoyed the actors performance but the plot itself. Many claimed it was more than just a spinoff of the Rocky movies, but "a spiritual remake of the 1976 film that retells the original story in the kind of involving way one would not have thought possible." Giving Ryan Coogler his highest rating film of an 8.7/10.
