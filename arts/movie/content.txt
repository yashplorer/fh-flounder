“How Much Money Star Wars Fans Are Paying For Scalped Opening Night Tickets”
Tickets went on sale for Star Force: The Force Awakens last month. Demand for tickets for the movie exceeded the supply.  After tickets ran out of supply people turned to private sellers. People report that private sellers have marked up ticket prices by at most a factor of 10.
Your nearby cinema will not cost its normal 20$. For this movie event you might need to pay up to 200$ for tickets to the day of premier. According to Yahoo some have bought tickets exceeding the price of a 1000$.  These tickets however include a after party hosted at Disneyland. 
The movie has already sold more than 50$ million dollar in advanced tickets. Prices are only expected to increase, as time towards the release date of the movie is getting closer.  This trend may set precedence where tickets for opening day movies may be more expensive, even at the box office.
