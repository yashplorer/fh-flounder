Holiday is a time for joy and love, while being around your family and friends. While during the season of giving and receiving, you appreciate the ones around. Its starts with the people you know when it comes to buying gifts or making their favorite dish.  This is the time of year to show your family and friend how much you care for them and want to show them not by just buying gifts but being in their lives. What are things that your family or friends do to show that they care and are happy that they are in your life?  During the Christmas holiday people get excited about the food that about to be served and have been waiting all year for that one dish, cookies, candy, the goodies that makes our day. While getting ready for the holidays depending on where you live, it could be a great time to play in the snow with cousins, friends, family or if you live in the sun time to go hiking with loved ones. Overall holiday time is for giving and being around the people you love while eating the amazing food that you and your family or friends have created to come together as whole. Enjoy your holiday times of vacation with the ones you call family.
