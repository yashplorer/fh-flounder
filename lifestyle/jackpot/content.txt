Jackpot Winners Death

We have seen many Jackpot winners out there doing different things, but this one is not only different, it is unique. Justin Reiter from Alberta, Canada, decided to ‘golden’ himself. The 27 yearold proceeded to spend his recent jackpot win on gold plating his genitals. Lavishly buying gold in itself is quite common for jackpot winners or billionaires, but plating it to one self’s part on their body is quite unusual. While getting the “gold mouth” could be the trend, especially amongst gangsters/rappers these days, getting gold private parts may have taken it to a whole another level. Reiter went ahead to surgical doctors to get this procedure done. He had been rejected here and there, and constantly being stopped to proceed with the idea, considering how lethal it could be on him. However, his determination was strong enough that he found himself a doctor that is willing to do it. They initially started by using a lead base paint, but Reiter demanded that a simple coloring wasn’t enough, he needed the real gold. To make sure this goes well, Reiter used professional automotive gold plater he happened to borrow from a garage. But unfortunately, in the process of around twelve hours of the operation, Reiter died. The reports of his autopsy shows that the actual cause of his death was the lead based paint poisoning.
